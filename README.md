diabAdviser – Online Diabetes Advising Community  

In, Sri Lanka medical advising systems are not much automated. Because of the society does not know the benefits of a medical advising system.
Diabetes is a condition that is spreading in the society, young or old, without distinction. Therefore, it is very important to control it as a country. The main objective of this system is to control the disease and make a better relationship between patients and doctors about the disease recurs awareness.
In order to achieve the main objective of the system, object oriented programing has been used. System analyzing details, system designing details, system implementation details and system testing details are included in the report. 

In Sri Lanka people don’t attend regular checkups on diabetics as more 50% of diabetic patients are live with diabetics. They meet doctors when they feel some illness or some difficulty. Because of high cost of medical checkups and the huge queue in both government hospitals and the private hospitals, people missed up their regular checkups.
To address the above problem and to provide guide to diabetic patients, an automated mobile application was developing to keep continuous connection with prospective doctors. 
In the developed system both patient and doctor register online to the mobile application. Patients are free to select a registered doctor by paying appointment payment. Once a patient selects a doctor they can ask questions and input their glucose level (random or fasting blood sugar). Once patient request advices the selected doctor who registered in the system will be response with valuable advises. 
Health advises for patients are received by doctors who registered in the system through this system easily.
However, this is not a free service for patients, because doctor’s service won’t be given free of charge in a country like Sri Lanka. So doctor’s charge (This amount will be decided by the doctor when he/she registering on the application) must be paid by patients to get their instructions or advises through the system.   
Doctor registration on the system is provided through a web application and patient registration is provided through a mobile application by the system. 
Additionally, the amount paid by patient through the system will be send to the relevant doctor monthly via system administrator after reduce the maintenances cost of the system. 

The purpose of this system is to control the disease and make a better relationship between patients and doctors. 
Admin, doctor and patient are the user type which are available on the system. Admin is the responsible person for managing other user type users.
